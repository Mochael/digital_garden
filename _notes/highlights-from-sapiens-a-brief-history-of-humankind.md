title: Sapiens a Brief History of Humankind ðŸŒ±
---

- I can confidently say that this is my favorite book. Yuval Noah Harari gives a very informational, yet compelling recount of human history, detailing the most influential innovations and where they immerged.
- In school, I found history to be pretty boring, because there wasn't much analysis on why events transpired. Instead, the focus in school was about what had happened. In this book, Harari uncompromisingly presents his opinions surrounding humanity's evolution, which makes the story of humanity so much more compelling.
- I learned so much about how society has evolved since humans emerged from monkeys. The book also made me reflect on what makes us truly human and where humanity is headed in the future.
- I would definitely recommend reading this book.
