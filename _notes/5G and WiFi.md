## How does the Internet Work

## Great Explanation Here:

- When we call people we actually use a 4G cellular network
- Cell phones send signals to cell towers, and the cell towers send the signals out to a much larger network (using things often like fiber optic cables) and the right server that  can process your request

## How Does Wifi Work:
- A computer's wireless adapter translates data into a radio signal and transmits it using an antenna.
- A wireless router receives the signal and decodes it. The router sends the information to the Internet using a physical, wired Ethernet connection.
- Your router is physically connected to the modem which receives information from your ISP through the phone lines, optical fiber, or coaxial cable in your home (depending on your service provider) and converts it into a digital signal. The routerâ€™s job is to push this signal out to connected devices, either through wired Ethernet cables or Wi-Fi, so that all of your devices can hop on board and access the Internet. Your router and ISP canâ€™t communicate directly because they speak different languagesâ€”or rather, they transmit different signal typesâ€”which is why the modemâ€™s role as a translator is so important.
- ISP is then likely a part of a larger network which then routes information across itself and to other networks (the internet is just a network of networks)

## How Will 5G Interface with AI

- There are already billions of connected devices and it is just a matter time until we reach a world with connections in the trillions. As these devices communicate and sense their surroundings, from a high-definition camera recognizing an object to a simple sensor measuring the temperature, the massive amount of generated data cannot be easily transmitted back to a central entity (i.e., the cloud) to be processed and managed. To solve this massive scale challenge, as well as address privacy and security concerns, we need to shift to a decentralized model. In this new paradigm, intelligence is not just associated with a central cloud, it is distributed to the devices that form the Wireless Edge. This will require on-device capabilities for smartphones, cars, sensors, and other connected things, so they can perceive, reason, and act on their own, processing low entropy data and transmitting only the relevant content back to the cloud. The shift to on-device intelligence can bring in broader societal benefits ranging from improved driver safety, more personalized virtual assistants, superior photography, and enhanced security, to cameras with privacy, better connected health care, and more intuitive robotics.
 - Another use is for security where AI could be used to detect anomalies in network traffic, such as flooding or impersonation, by detecting unusual spectrum usage.
 - In addition, AI can improve environmental and contextual sensing, where it can pinpoint the useful radio waves given a bunch of complex signals that are always permeating in denser areas.
