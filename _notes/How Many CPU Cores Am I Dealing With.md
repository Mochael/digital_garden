On my mac, there are six CPU cores available. This means that there are six independent physical processors in the computer's motherboard. But, my computer uses multithreading to run tasks, and each CPU core is capable of running at most 2 threads at the same time. So there are actually 12 **logical cores** available, meaning that the computer is capable of separately managing 12 different tasks in parallel.
