# The Kronovet Family has been Making Clothing for Generations

- Started with my grandfather's grandfather Samuel Kronovet
- My sister has her own clothing company
- Going to look at the evolution of the clothing business in my family over time

---

# Who was Samuel Kronovet
- He immigrated from the Austria-Hungary in like 1886
- He only spoke of two things: business and the torah
- Interestingly, my grandfather's other grandfather was a tailor
- Samuel lived in east side of NY where he worked for some clothing comopany then became a **peddler** for men's underwear and socks
	- **peddler** is someone who travels to different retail stores to sell them clothing
	- Stores often relied on credit to buy from him
		- same thing in my father's business
	- he was actually the middleman
- A bunch of people joined the business and went all over to sell stuff

---
# Credit in the Clothing 
- Retail stores don't have enough money lying around to pay for the clothes that are in their stores. How can they order more clothes?
- Manufacturer will give them **credit** which is basically saying that the store can pay the manufacturer later after the store makes enough money
- Small manufacturers like my dad will use a **factor** to make sure that he gets money from the retail stores
	- **Factor** will give my dad like 70% of the invoice value (money retail store owes) up front and then
		- then after the factor is tasked with collecting the money from the retail store and they take maybe 4%


---

# The Beginning of the Business
- Samuel then opened his own retail store and became a **wholesaler**
	- **wholesalers** buy in bulk from manufacturers and sell smaller orders to retailers
	- main business was wholesaler

---
# If he had a retail store and was a wholesaler, couldn't the prices in his retail store undercut other retailers?
### A Typical Price Cycle:
1. Say we are making a shirt in China and manufacturing costs $15
2. My dad buys this for $45 and then sells it to retail stores for $90
3. Retail stores then sell it to you for $200
- So since you are buying in bulk as the wholesaler then you can have better prices than the other retailers who need to buy it from you at higher prices
	- Turns out that it was too hard for people to travel back then so the only people who could come to your store were people in the neighborhood because of crappy transportation in the old days

# Grandpa get's into the family business
- Samuel had 5 sons who all worked for him in the business and 3 daughters who didn't work in it
- My grandfather went to school for accounting, but then hated the work so he started working for my dad's company
- manufaturing was too expensive up north so they moved it south
	- Grandpa moved to Statesville, NC to manage a factory in Hickory
		- He had about 35 people working for him at the factory (he worked with an experienced dude who showed him how to run the factory Joe Jay)
		- made golf shirts
	- Grandpa moves to Charlotte to restart factory by a city and Joe Jay and workers didn't come with him
	  - had to start fresh in Charlotte

# Becoming the Head Hancho of Westbury
- Eventually people in the family wanted to sell the business but nobody wanted to buy it
- My grandfather decided to buy out his dad and uncles and grandfather
	- it took him 12 years to pay off debt from buying the 
	- they made golf shirts and sweaters
- At this point there were 5 factories all in NC when grandpa bought the business
- grandpa knew how to run the whole business and he focused on selling to the big businesses and brother in law started handling ssmaller people
- sold to JC Penny, Sears, K-Mart other big ones
- My dad and uncle worked for my grandfather
---

# Tales of Alfred: Shifting Ownership
- Of Samuel's sons, he was the only one to go to college and he became a lawyer before coming back to help run the family business
1. Denial of swimsuit business to grandpa's brother in law
2. Don't pay your uncle, Dave

---

# The Beginning of the End
- In the 1990s Clinton was big on free trade and this exported low wage jobs to other countries
- Westbury loses its biggest customer
	- Grandfather had just bought $1 million of machines
- Factories close one buy one and eventually have to sell machines for $50,000

---

# Staying Afloat
- In debt from buying building and machines
- Attempted ventures:
	- government contracts
	- family dollar
	- Bellini baby stores
- Survived off renting out factory buildings and then selling them off
	- Copper wire lawsuit extravaganza

---

# Clothing Forever!
- My dad started his own business selling to a bunch of small stores for a higher **margin** compared to the old business
	- **Margin** is the difference in money between the cost it takes to produce a product and the price of someone buying it
- "The government fucked me then and they're still fucking me now"
- It is a hussle

---

# The Modern Era: Ameliora
- Fully online clothing store
- Usually in my dad's business clothes are seasonal, but women's business attire is always in demand, so they can keep them in inventory forever
- Women's empowerment
