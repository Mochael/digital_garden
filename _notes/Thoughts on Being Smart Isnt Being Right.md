I was watching a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCsgoLc_fzI), where a brilliant physics professor bets a famous youtuber $10,000 that a completely wind powered car could not move faster than the wind powering it. The physics professor proved his case by mathematically showing that the car could not truly overcome the wind and shut down the youtuber's empirical evidence for the car traveling faster by  mathematically explaining nuances with how the measurements were conducted. His theory was able to convince both Bill Nye and Neil Degrass Tyson that the car could not in fact go faster than the wind. The youtuber was undeterred though, building his own mini-car, winning the bet, and showing once for all the car was truly faster than the wind that powered it

I was stunned watching these scientific lumaries get so confuzzled by a seemingly very simple question. How are we supposed to work on quantum mechanics when our best are still essentially racing matchbox cars to prove their points (I actually love that the youtuber did this). I took away two main things from this:
1. Shit is really confusing. I had no idea who was going to be right or wrong. There were  so many nuances that the professor showed needed to be considered. It put things into perspective how even though some things seem simple, often there is a ton of complicated shit underlying it.
2. This is a more interesting insight that I picked up from Jonathan Hoidt in his book [Highlights from The Righteous Mind](Highlights%20from%20The%20Righteous%20Mind.md). In this book, Jonathan Hoidt explains how intelligent people can often be incredibly biased in their viewpoints (just like the rest of us) and how the most intellligent people are not the ones who are correct in their opinions, beliefs, or theories but rather that they are the best at backing up their points. The physics professor presented a brilliant argument, and although wrong, he convinced two other well known scientists that he was correct. It makes me think that this is probably what happened with people like Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein. They developed theories that they thought must be correct about how the universe works based on their views of the world, and then they used their intelligence to develop math that would prove them right. It's a testiment to their intelligence that they were able to create such good models, but we know they aren't fully correct and can't explain everything we observe. Are we biased to accept the vision of the world by the smartest who can offer better explanations for their views of the world? Maybe the world would be a better place if people used their intellect to try and prove other peoples ideas, or ideas contrary to their own. But, that probably contradicts human nature.
