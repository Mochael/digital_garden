title: What is firmware

Firmware is a small piece of software that interfaces with the hardware on a device to make sure it works as the manufacturer intended it to. It's basically the middleman between your OS and your hardware.

For simple devices like traffic lights, washing machines, etc. the firmware is the entirety of the software on the device.

A computer motherboard without firmware would not know how to detect the hard drive or the video card found inside your computer. If your hard drives didn't have firmware embedded in them, they wouldn't know how fast to spin or when to stop. A wireless network card wouldn't know how to use a particular radiofrequency for connecting to Wi-Fi.

### BIOS and UEFI

In the case of a personal computer, we call it the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) or UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface). 
- BIOS is the first software IBM PC compatible computers run when powered on. The BIOS is responsible for waking up your computerâ€™s hardware components, ensures theyâ€™re functioning properly, and then runs the another program called a bootloader that boots the OS sleeping inside the hard drive to put it in the random access memory (RAM).
- UEFI is the new replacement for BIOS (your hardware either supports one or the other) that boots faster and can boot from drives with more data (BIOS was limited to drives with udner 2.1 terabytes.)
