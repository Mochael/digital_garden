### SAFE
At a seed or preseed level of funding, companies often get funding through SAFE (simpleÂ _agreement_Â for future equity) agreements. SAFEs were created by Y combinator in 2013. Since it's really hard to value a company that is getting seed/pre-seed funding, these agreements just specify that you will give them money now, in exchange for an equity grant that is determined by a future priced round of funding. So for example, a company can raise money via a SAFE at pre-seed and agree to give the VC shares based on price per share at the future series A share price.

### Convertible notes
A **convertible note** is a loan that typically converts into shares of preferred stock during your next equity financing. Convertible notes are debt financing and have an interest rate and a maturity date -- just like the loan on your house or car.

### Discounts
Convertible notes and SAFEs can both be structured with a discount that rewards early investors for taking a really big risk. The **discount** gives them the right to convert their investment at a reduced price to whatâ€™s paid by the next roundâ€™s equity investors. For example, if a note is sold with a 20 percent discount and the company sells shares of Series A Preferred Stock in a qualified financing for $1 per share, then the outstanding balance on the note at the time of the qualified financing would convert into shares of Series A Preferred Stock at a price of $0.80 per share.

### Valuation Cap
A "valuation cap" entitles note holders to convert the outstanding balance on the note into shares of stock at the lower of (i) the valuation cap or (ii) the price per share in a qualified financing (or, if there is a discount in the note, then the discounted price per share). The valuation CAP is designed to provide a ceiling on the price the note holders would be deemed to pay for the stock they get on conversion. For example, if your business raises a venture round at a $10 million pre-financing valuation but your notes have a $3 million cap, your note holders just got aÂ **70%**Â discount (yep, you read that right).
