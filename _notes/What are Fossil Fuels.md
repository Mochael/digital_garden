Fossil fuels are a group of energy sources (coal, oil, and natural gas) that were formed by the decompositon of ancient organisms over millions of years. The fossils of ancient organisms were buried under sand and dirt under water so that they were shielded from oxygen and decomposed anaerobically. The type of the organisms, temperature, time, and pressure all impact whether the decomposed fossils were turned into coal, oil, or natural gas. We harness energy from these sources by burning them (combustion).
