title: highlights from Leonardo da Vinci
---

- Before I read this book, I only knew about the legend of Leonardo Da Vinci, the quintessential “Renaissance Man” and creator of some of the most famous art pieces in history. It was difficult to conceptualize him as an actual human being.
- The author did a great job of demystifying who Leonardo was by extensive research through his journals. I was quite surprised to learn that Leonardo was an erratic and frenzied thinker, who never completed his commissioned work.
- Leonardo had a fascinating mind, which the book explored intimately through Leonardo’s notebooks. His disorderly, meandering, and flurried notes posited some really odd questions that I never would have thought to ask. I was inspired to be more inquisitive about the way things work.
- Leonardo curiosity drove him explore optics, anatomy, art, engineering and many other fields, and his knowledge in one field complemented his abilities in the next, making him a true polymath.
