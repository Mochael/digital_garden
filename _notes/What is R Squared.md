$R^2$ is the proportion of variance explained in the independent variable by the dependent variable. It can be calculated as follows where $\bar{y} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_i^n y_i$ and $\hat{y}_i$ are the predictions of $y_i$ from the dependent variables $x_i$ :

$$R^{2}(y, \hat{y})=1-\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(y_{i}-\hat{y}_{i}\right)^{2}}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(y_{i}-\bar{y}\right)^{2}}$$
