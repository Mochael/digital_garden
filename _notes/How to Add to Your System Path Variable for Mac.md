Put the following command in your .zshrc file in your root directory
`export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH`

- The first **PATH** contains all the directories that we want to source from the terminal
- **/usr/local/bin** is the path that we want to add to be sourced
- **:$PATH** references the current value **PATH**, so everything that is already sourced in the .zshrc file
- So, the variable path looks something like this with a colon between each path:
  - PATH= /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games
