Sweat droplets absorb your thermal energy and then evaporate taking the thermal energy from your body out of the system.

In more humid environments itâ€™s harder for sweat to evaporate and dispel the  thermal energy from your body.
- So you will sweat more with more humidity, since you will need to be cooled down more
