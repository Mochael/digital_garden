## 5G Stock

- Very important that I learn how 5G works:
  - Companies that enable 5g hardware to work really well
  - Companies that enable 5g software to work really well
- Calix Inc
- Ubiquiti Inc
  - this is a company that provides wifi routers and stuff, so this is not a good 5g investment (it wouldbe hedging 5G)
- Lumentum Holdings (LITE stock)
  - fiber optic cable stock (the 5G routers will be connected to the bigger networks using fiber optic cables)
- XILINX INC
  - Semiconductor manufacturing company that's working on programmable 5G chips or something like that
- Defiance Next Gen Connectivity ETF
  - 5G ETF can search for companies that are within the ETF

  - headquartered in Leuven, Belgium, is one of the largest and most long-established independent companies in the 3D printing / additive manufacturing sector

  - some noninvasive way to clean arteries
