## Things to do to Prep
- [ ] Read **Cracking the Coding Interview** cover to cover
	- [ ]  https://github.com/careercup/CtCI-6th-Edition-Python  
	- [ ]  https://github.com/w-hat/ctci-solutions (slightly better one)  
- [ ] Study how to write code following **test-driven-development (TDD)**
	- [ ] https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html
- [ ] Read **Intro to Algos**
	- [ ] https://github.com/RbkGh/Free-Algorithm-Books/blob/master/
	- [ ] 1-12 (super heavy) [got really comfortable with sorting]
	- [ ] 13-14 (skimmed)
	- [ ] 15-16 (skimmed) (watched youtube videos instead)
	- [ ] 18-21 (read)
	- [ ] 22-26 (HEAVY) [ran into a TON of graph-like problems]
	- [ ] 27-34 (glanced)
	- [ ] Made sure to be able to implement main sorting algos by hand
- [ ] Relearn important built in python
	- [ ] https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html
	- [ ] https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html
	- [ ] https://docs.python.org/3/library/queue.html
	- [ ] https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html
- [ ] **Leetcode** nonstop after reading **Cracking the Coding Interview** and **Intro to Algos**
	- [ ] Focusing on easy/medium but try to do a hard question every day

### Topics to Study
- [ ] Sorting algorithms
- [ ] Dynamic programming
- [ ] Graph traversal algorithms

### General Programming Steps
- [ ] Write main function to execute unit tests
- [ ] Write test class and internal test functions
- [ ] Write the actual solutions
