Delta:
-   Amount that change in underlying stock will change price of option. So if $1 increase in stock causes $0.65 change in option, then delta is 0.65
-   The deeper in the money the option is, the closer the absolute value of delta approaches 1 (i.e. the more that the option will behave like the asset)

  

Gamma:
-   rate of change in options delta as the underlying asset changes price
-   So itâ€™s the 2nd derivative of option price as a function of underlying price
