The runtime of a language is the code that the programming language itself injects into your program so that your program can be run. So it is the underlying code in your project that you didn't write. Runtimes for C and Rust are much smaller than runtimes for python and Ruby, since they are much lower level. Assembly is the only language without a runtime because it directly *assembles* to binary machine code.
