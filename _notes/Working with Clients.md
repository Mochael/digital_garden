- Don't announce your inexperience
- Also if your not really sure of something, let other people go first to get a feel of how it should be done
- If someone else makes a mistake that doesn't need to be pointed out to a client, don't point it out

- The way you speak definitely matters for how you are perceived. Speaking intelligently with understandable but smart language. Answering questions intelligently, making sure that questions are answered directly, ad asking for clarification

- make sure that everything is addressed before ending a meeting:
	- if you don't know the answer to something, then leave with how you will get the answer


- when you have the content but it is unnecessary to extend a meeting past the time it was scheduled for, it shows respect for people's time when you don't needlessly extend a meeting or are willing to end it early after everything has been resolved
