I was listening to [The Knowledge Project Podcast episode featuring Maria Konnikova](https://fs.blog/knowledge-project/maria-konnikova/), where [Shane Parrish](https://fs.blog/about/) and [Maria Konnikova](http://www.mariakonnikova.com/about/) mentioned [Immanuel Kant's](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Immanuel-Kant) philosophy that we should bet on whether the facts/arguments we espouse are true or not. The purpose of this exercise is that it encourages us to reflect on whether our reasoning is sound or not. I may think that the Tampa Bay Buccaneers will win the next Super Bowl since they now have Tom Brady as well as Rob Gronkowski on their team. But, if you asked me how much I'd bet on them winning the Super Bowl, I'd be hard-pressed to bet more than $10. This may partially be because I am risk averse, but mostly it is because my reasoning for picking them as the winners rests with 2 players when a team is made up of 55 players on a roster. Asking myself to bet on the chance of the Buccanners winning encourages me to question my reasoning for picking them and then refine my opinions. I really do think that Kant was on to something with this.
