- Tennis is quite a mentally taxing game by itself, but mixing in the pressure from Andre Agassi's personal life (like his crazy father), I have no idea how he was able to become so great. I was on the edge of my seat when he was giving play-by-plays of some of his most famous matches, because I didn't actually know who won. It was also incredible to learn about what he was thinking and feeling during these matches. Like for example how he had to get cortisol shots in his back hours before a match when he was older. We put a lot of pressure on athletes to just go out and perform, but we don't realize the mental and physical hurdles that these athletes have to overcome off the court.
- The most important thing I took away from this book is the sentiment that there is always another match. I wish I had realized this when I was younger and still training my tennis. I used to put way too mmuch pressure on myself to win and perform well, which actually worked to my detriment. I would get too frustrated if I missed a few shots and my mental game would fall apart. I didn't really enjoy playing because of the pressure I put on myself, which resulted in me not training as hard and taking away little from my matches.
