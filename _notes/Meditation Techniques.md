### Mindfulness Meditation
- relax and observe your thoughts as they happen, but do not interact with them or judge them. Just let them pass.

Example (using your breath to relax mind):
- For 10 min, bring your attention to breathing. Notice when your mind wanders from your breath. When it does, gently return your attention to breathing â€“ there is no need to bock your thoughts or to try and force yourself to eliminate thinking.

### ConcentrationÂ Meditation
- The goal of this is to focus intently on something and whenever your mind wanders bring it back into focus on this single thing

Example (focusing on an object):
1.  For 10 min, focus on the flame of a candle â€“ do not let your focus wave away. If any thoughts come to your mind, push them away and continue focusing on the flame.

I think you could also apply this type of meditation to thinking about events. You can try to focus on some moment in the past that occurred and try to remove your judgement on the event and be impartial.

### Transcendental Meditation
- In this form of meditation you relax and repeat a personal mantra in your head (I think some people advocate saying it out loud). It seems that there isn't any consensus on what the mantra is:
	- Some advocate using some phrase/sound that means nothing to you like "shumwama papot"
	- Some advocate using a phrase or word that means something to you.

You're supposed to perform this meditation forÂ 15-20min, twice a day.
