title: highlights from Stumbling on Happiness
---

- We usually judge things in the future based on how we feel now. Try to be aware of this and realize that how you feel in the future is different than how you feel now.
- When having sex with someone you don’t think about who you could be having sex with, even though you may think you are missing out when sitting around thinking about being with that person.
- We regret inaction more than action because at least with action we can learn from the experience while with inaction there is no experience to learn from
- Similar to how genes that encourage sex would be passed on to more people, statements/beliefs that promote stable society even if they are true or false would be passed on through communication like DNA replication
- Hearing how someone else who actually experienced something enjoyed the experience (regardless of who they are) is much more accurate than trying to imagine how you will like something
- Shortcomings of imagination: imagination ignores some things and emphasizes other things that aren’t correct about an experience, how you feel in the moment will influence how you think you will feel when you imagine something, once things happen your brain will re-evaluate the situation which will change your perspective of it
