Modern software expects to be split into different modules, each with a different level of access to system and processor resources. Exception levels are referred to as `EL<x>`, with x as a number between 0 and 3 and denote the level of priviledge that part of the computer software has.

One of the kernelâ€™s tasks is to lie to each application running in userland and to tell them that theyâ€™re the only one in the address space. It does that by using the memory management unit (MMU). The MMU allows creating an alias from a virtual address to a real physical address in e.g. RAM. The smallest granularity of this mapping is called a page which is usually 4KiB large. Each page has a virtual address and a physical address. When an instruction of an application or the kernel itself now tries to access memory at location `x` the MMU looks up the page in its pagetable and instead returns memory from another address `y`. And thatâ€™s how the kernel can give each userland application its own separate address space: It just creates a different set of pagetables for each process.
