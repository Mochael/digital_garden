title: How Does Version Naming Work
tree_state: ðŸŒ±

Things are versioned with names like `3.4.13`

This follows the structure of: `Major.minor.patch`

`patch`: don't change API at all
- Everything from before still works the same pretty much for a user

`Minor`: backwards patable
- just adding things so existing stuff still works

`Major`: very large changes that aren't necessarily backwards compatible
- previous API calls won't work the same way
