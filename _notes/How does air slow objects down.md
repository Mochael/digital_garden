title: How does air slow objects down

There are two main ways that air slows objects down:
- Air is not very viscous so for **fast** objects air creates resistance mostly by momentum it takes to push the air out of the way (think conservation of momentum law)
	- Since the amount of energy the object transmits into the air particles is dependent on the speed of the object, the slower the object is, the less significant the transfer of momentum from the object to the air will be on slowing the object.
- So for **slower** objects the majority of the slowing from air comes directly from the viscosity of air.
