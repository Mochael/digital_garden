### Traditional 401K

Your contributions are made **pre-tax**, which reduces your taxable income. When youâ€™re ready to use your 401(k) during retirement, youâ€™ll have to pay taxes on any withdrawals.

### Roth 401(k)

Your contributions are made **after-tax** and have no effect on your taxable income. When youâ€™re ready to use the funds in this account for retirement, youâ€™ll be able to withdraw without having to pay taxes or penalties on those contributions.

- it seems that Roth 401k may earn me more money if my tax bracket is anywhere near my tax bracket now, which it probably will be, unless I move up in the tax bracket over time, haha then it may not be worth

### Comparing These Plans

- plans seem to be fairly equal when accounting for stock market gains:
  - Traditional allows you to get more stock gains initially but then taxes them later
  - Roth gives you less principal to gain from, but large stock gains won't be taxed later
