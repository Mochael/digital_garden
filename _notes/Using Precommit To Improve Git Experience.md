## If using Commitizen here is the style you need to follow
```
<type>(<optional scope>): <subject>

<optional body>

<optional footer>
```

Reference here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QrDFcIiPjSLDn3EL15IJygNPiHORgU1_OOAqWjiDU5Y/edit

#### Examples
```
docs: update changelog to beta.5
```

```
docs(changelog): update changelog to beta.5
```

```
fix(release): need to depend on latest rxjs and zone.js

The version in our package.json gets copied to the one we publish, and users need the latest of these.
```


### Type

Must be one of the following:

-   **build**: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
-   **ci**: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
-   **docs**: Documentation only changes
-   **feat**: A new feature
-   **fix**: A bug fix
-   **perf**: A code change that improves performance
-   **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
-   **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
-   **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests

### Scope
The scope should be the name of the npm package affected (as perceived by the person reading the changelog generated from commit messages.

### Subject

The subject contains a succinct description of the change:

### Body

Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes". The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

### Footer

The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.

**Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.

### Revert

If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert:` , followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.
