title: highlights from Hacking Darwin ðŸŒ±
---

- It was fascinating to read this book and learn about the future of personalized medicine and recent innovations in biotechnology and genetics. I had no idea that biotechnology had come so far.
- This book is what first sparked my interest in biology, and it inspired me to start doing research in computational biology at CMU.
- One of the most interesting things I recall from reading was: experiments have successfully shown that you can take a specialized adult cell and transform it back into a stem cell that can then differentiate into whatever you want. Some of the applications of this are really crazy, like in the future we will be able to draw someones blood, convert those blood cells into some egg cells and sperm cells and then create a child made completely from that person. Freaky.
