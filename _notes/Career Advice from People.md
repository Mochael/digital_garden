Brad from Virtu:
-   Company name and prestige is not really important. What is important is the people that you work with and the actual work you do
-   Donâ€™t be afraid to present new and interesting ideas even if they are not the norm
-   Often the short term can lead to the long term. Itâ€™s not really good to hop around from company to company searching for the best pay. Doing what you like and sticking with it is a good way to meet people that can influence your life trajectory


Steve from Compose:
- work at a VC fund, because you will develop connections to a ton of incredible people/companies


Breath becomes air book:
-   Personal experience is most important for understanding feelings and morality. Moral action is more important than moral philosophizing
