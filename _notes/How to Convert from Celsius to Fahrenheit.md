$F = \frac{9}{5}(c+40)-40$
$C = \frac{5}{9}(c+40)-40$
- Farenheit and Celcuis are equal at $-40$ degrees
- So this equation is like moving the line to 0, squishing it based on sensitity to change, and then shifting it back
- Just need to remember that Farenheit is more sensative than celcius, hence the larger slope
