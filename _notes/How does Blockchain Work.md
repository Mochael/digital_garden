I have 100 of cryptocurrency shitpoo that I want to transfer it to my friend, Phil. How do I transfer him shitpoo? Before I even can transfer Phil money, how does the shitpoo network even know that I have 100 shitpoo tokens?

## Question 1: How does network know about my shitpoo
Somewhere there needs to be a ledger of who owns what coins and how many they owe. So, a bunch of people decided to store this ledger on their computer, because they wouldn't trust you storing the only copy. You can imagine that when there are a lot of updates to be made their ledgers might become out of sync and differ.

## Question 2: How does the transaction go through network know about my shitpoo


## Two main crypto concepts
1. Ledger
2. Transaction validation
