title: Why are Conjugate Priors Useful

Suppose our prior follows a beta distribution $$p(\theta) \sim Beta(\alpha,\beta)$$ and we have a binomial likelihood $$p(x\mid\theta)$$
$$
p(\theta \mid x) = p(x \mid \theta) p(\theta)
$$
Since the beta is a conjugate prior for the binomial likelihood, we can show that $$p(\theta \mid x) \sim Beta(k+\alpha,n-k+\beta)$$

- We don't need to actually calculate this $p(\theta \mid x)$ with the computer since it just follows a known distribution and the MAP estimate for this distribution will be of the same form as the optimal estimate of $p(\theta)$, just with the adjusted values:
$$k+\alpha, \ n-k+\beta$$
