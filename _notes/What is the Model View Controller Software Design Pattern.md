There are 3 components, the model, the view, and the controller.

## Model

The central component of the pattern. It is the application's dynamic data structure, independent of the user interface. It directly manages the data, logic, and rules of the application.

## View

The user interface. Any representation of information such as a chart, diagram or table. Multiple views of the same information are possible, such as a bar chart for management and a tabular view for accountants.

## Controller

Accepts input and converts it to commands for the model or view.
