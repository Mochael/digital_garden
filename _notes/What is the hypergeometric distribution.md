Suppose a population consists of $N$ items, $k$ of which are successes. And a random sample drawn from that population consists of $n$ items, $x$ of which are successes. Then the hypergeometric probability is: 

$$P(x \mid N, n, k) = \frac{{{k} \choose {x}} {{N-k} \choose {n-x}}}{{{N} \choose {n}}}$$

- The number of combinations between:
	- Ways to choose x successes from k successes
	- Ways to choose n-x successes from N-k successes
- Divided by number of ways to choose n samples from N total items
