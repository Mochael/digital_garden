title: highlights from Thinking Fast and Slow ðŸŒ±
---

- This book made me more conscious of the way my mind functions to make decisions. While reading this book, I would reflect on times when I had made silly mistakes by blindly following my system 1 (instinct based decision making).
- The book provided many different interesting puzzles, illusions, and situations which confused me and made me more aware of how my brain recognized patterns and could be tricked.
- I am more aware of my instinctual decision making tendencies, and I actively try to take more time to think through a problem before trying to solve it.
