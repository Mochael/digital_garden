- Effect research is an extension of personal growth: learning in a field will lead you to developing things that help others in the field

- I need clarity on what I want to achieve, why I want to achieve it, and how I can go about achieving it
  - lack of clarity is what often causes me to be lazy or not to want to work on something

"In my opinion the reason most people fail to do great research is that they are not willing to pay the price in self-development. Say some new field opens up that combines field X and field Y. Researchers from each of these fields flock to the new field. My experience is that *virtually none* of the researchers in either field will systematically learn the other field in any sort of depth. The few who do put in this effort often achieve spectacular results."



Have different formulations of tyour problem and don't hold close and stick to a single formulation. Use different formulations to see if someone has solved a similar problem.
