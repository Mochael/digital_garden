My first job had a  pretty  confusing  structure to it, since it was a startup studio. The first six  months that I worked at the studio, I was placed on a specific team, but I wasn't an "official"  employee of that team during the  first six months. I only became an "official" employee of that company after  working  on that same project  for about six months. Since I started at the studio, I had been repeatedly asking when I would receive my full time assignment to a specific company, and after putting it off for six months, management (small company so really just the CEO) decided to place me. Once a became an employee  of the operating company  I had been working on, I finally received shares in the company, albeit with an odd vesting schedule. Conventionally with the operating companies, your shares started to accumulate as soon  as you join the studio, so I had shares  in a different  operating company with a 1 year cliff and a vesting date that started as soon as I joined the  studio. However, my vesting period for the company I had been working on for almost a year didn't start until 6  months after I joined the company.

Person A:
- Joins the studio and is officially placed in the operating company full time.
Person  B:
- Joins the studio and the works on the same project as person A for six months without being officially assigned to that company.

Person A and B had been doing the same thing but person A has 6 months more of equity than person B.
- I was person B in this situation and my other friend at the  company who I worked with was person A.

I had a conversion with our defacto admin person and also the CEO of the studio (and de-facto leader of my specific operating company) about the equity structure and I feel like I learned a lot, especially about how NOT to interact with employees.


## Lessons Learned

#### Care and Pay Attention
I first reached out to my company's admin person via slack, and I could tell that they did not even take the time to read the message or look into what I said before telling me that everything was as it should be.

If I am the boss of someone, I want to always go the extra mile to make sure  they know that  I care about them. Devoting so much time and  effort  to a company, only  to see that the upper management doesn't care  about you is really disheartening. This is  especially  what I wanted when  working  at  a  startup, which is really disappointing to not  have.

#### It's not about beating your employees
Then I set a meeting with our admin person and they essentially tried to dodge my  questions and gaslight me about what I was asking for. I was repeatedly told that I was lucky to be receiving  equity  in a  different company that had started a week before I joined the studio, basically telling me that I had no right to inquire if I wasn't happy with my equity.

The meeting went  similarly with the CEO who made it  a point to try and make my asks seem selfish and dumb. Inferring that I only  wanted the shares early so that I could take them  andd leave the company as  quick as  possible. This really upset met.

As a boss, why  would you belittle and jide your employees? In high tech industry where  churn is high, and it is valuable to retain  talent who has  built your product from the ground up, why would anyone do this. I  was completely  stunned. The important thing in management's eyes was beatinng me. They didn't care if I felt valued. They only cared that I stopped asking questions.

#### Be transparent
WHen  I first  joined  I repeatedly asked to be permanently assignedd. The mannagement kept putting it off more and more and I  kept asking,  but  I was eventually assigned and told it wouldn't impact me. This wasn't true at all, as I  ended up with  6 months fewer shares.

It's important  that we explain the complex parts of our company's operations to employees if they impact them. I feel like at my time in this company, the simple and mundane aspects were explained again  and again, but  the complex aspects weren't really discussed. That's a vital flaw.

####  Focus on whats Important
We recently lost another of our best  engineers  because they were being overworked,  undervalued, and not evenn working on  important  long term work that could benefit the company.

For me, there was no reason to withold the 6 months of equity. I was already allocated the shares, and I had already worked to earn them.

It makes much more sense to me to take a small hit of a little larger pay bump, giving an employee equity, etc. than losing their interest and loyalty. At a software company, the employees are the most valuable asset. They develop the entire product, without really  much capital but their brain power.

## Conclusion

Ultimately this was an informative experience. Often I  think since we spend sso much time at our jobs we start  tothink of  them ass more than a job. They become part of our identify. We idolize our managers and mentors, befriend other employees, and spend so much time even outside work talking/thinking about it. This experience has brought me back to the real world. Working at my company is a job. People are selfish and won't allow others if they feel it will undermine them.

If I start my own company or become a manager of others I am going to do my best to make them happy, but we will all still be working jobs, where our motivation is selfish.
