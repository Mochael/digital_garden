- Quantum computing relies on using quantum logic gates that take the form of unitary matrices. 
  - Unitary matrix $U$ is where $U^{t*} U = I$, where $U^{t*}$ is the complex conjugate transpose of  $U$ (transpose $U$ and then take the complex conjugate for every element)
  - Quantum bits are in a superposition of states, and when you measure the quantum bit you only get the output. So, if we can start with a either $|0 \rangle$ or $|1 \rangle$ and then do some of these unitary matrix transformations to get back a cubit as $|0 \rangle$ or $|1 \rangle$, then there is a probability of 0 or 1 for the value the cubit will take when it is observed. Therefore, there is no more ambiguity in what value the cubit will take.
